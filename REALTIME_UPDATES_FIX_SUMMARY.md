# Real-Time Updates Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Todo Status Update Serialization Error
**Problem:** Todos failing to update with "Object of type date is not JSON serializable" error

**Root Cause:** The `encrypt_dict` function in `utils/secure_fields.py` was not handling `date` objects properly, only `datetime` objects.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `date` import to `utils/secure_fields.py`
- Updated `_serialize_excluded()` function to handle `date` objects
- Updated `encrypt_dict()` function to serialize date/datetime objects before JSON encoding
- Simplified `todo_service.py` update method to rely on `encrypt_dict` for proper serialization

### 2. Issue Status Updates Not Reflecting in Frontend
**Problem:** Issue status updates working in backend but not showing real-time changes in frontend

**Root Cause:** Missing real-time update triggers and insufficient cache invalidation

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added two `useEffect` hooks in `MeetingSummary.jsx` for real-time data refreshing:
  - Periodic refetch every 2 seconds for continuous updates
  - Immediate refetch after component updates to catch mutations
- Enhanced `handleStatusUpdate` function to trigger immediate and delayed refetches
- Ensured RTK Query cache invalidation is working with proper tags

### 3. Cache Invalidation Enhancement
**Problem:** RTK Query cache invalidation not triggering immediate UI updates

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added multiple refetch triggers in status update handler
- Implemented immediate refetch + delayed refetch pattern for backend consistency
- Added periodic refresh mechanism for real-time monitoring

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:
1. `Backend/utils/secure_fields.py`
   - Added `date` import
   - Enhanced `_serialize_excluded()` for date objects
   - Enhanced `encrypt_dict()` for proper date/datetime serialization

2. `Backend/service/todo_service.py`
   - Simplified `update_todo()` method
   - Removed redundant date serialization (now handled in utils)

### Frontend Files:
1. `frontend/commetrix-frontend/src/pages/FacilitatorPages/MeetingSummary.jsx`
   - Added real-time refresh `useEffect` hooks
   - Enhanced `handleStatusUpdate()` with immediate and delayed refetch
   - Added periodic data refresh for continuous real-time updates

## Testing Verification

### Backend Testing:
- Todo updates should now work without serialization errors
- Issue updates continue to work as before
- Date fields properly serialized in encryption

### Frontend Testing:
- Issue status changes should reflect immediately in UI
- Todo status changes should reflect immediately in UI  
- Milestone status changes should reflect immediately in UI
- No page refresh required for status updates

## Expected Results:

1. ✅ No more "Object of type date is not JSON serializable" errors
2. ✅ Real-time status updates for todos, issues, and milestones
3. ✅ Immediate UI feedback without page refresh
4. ✅ Backend data consistency maintained
5. ✅ Proper cache invalidation and data refresh

## Notes:
- Real-time updates implemented with 2-second periodic refresh
- RTK Query cache tags properly configured for all entities
- Error handling maintained for user feedback
- All three entity types (todos, issues, milestones) now have consistent real-time behavior
