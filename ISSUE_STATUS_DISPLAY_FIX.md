# Issue Status Display Fix Summary

## Root Cause Identified ✅

**Problem:** Issue status updates were working in the backend and database, but the frontend was still showing all issues as "Pending" instead of reflecting their actual status.

**Root Cause:** The frontend `TaskListCard` component was only checking for `'completed'` and `'done'` statuses to determine if an item was completed, but **issues use `'resolved'` as their completed status**, not `'completed'`.

## Database Analysis
From the provided database data:
- Issues have status values: `"open"` (pending) and `"resolved"` (completed)
- Todo/Milestones have status values: `"pending"` and `"completed"`

## Frontend Logic Issue
The original code in `TaskListCard.jsx` line 380:
```javascript
const isCompleted = item.completed === true || item.status === 'completed' || item.status === 'done';
```

This logic **did not include `'resolved'`**, so issues with status `'resolved'` were being displayed as pending (red X icon) instead of completed (green check icon).

## Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Updated Completion Logic
**File:** `frontend/commetrix-frontend/src/components/TaskListCard.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
const isCompleted = item.completed === true || item.status === 'completed' || item.status === 'done';
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isCompleted = item.completed === true || 
                  item.status === 'completed' || 
                  item.status === 'done' || 
                  item.status === 'resolved';
```

### 2. Updated Tooltip Text for Different Entity Types
**Enhanced status tooltips to show appropriate text:**
- **Issues:** "Resolved" vs "Open"
- **Todos/Milestones:** "Completed" vs "Pending"

**Interactive buttons:** `Click to change status (Currently: Resolved/Open or Completed/Pending)`
**Display-only icons:** `Resolved/Open` or `Completed/Not completed`

## Expected Results ✅

1. **Issues with status `'resolved'` will now display with green check mark**
2. **Issues with status `'open'` will display with red X mark**
3. **Tooltips will show correct terminology for each entity type**
4. **All real-time updates will work consistently for todos, issues, and milestones**

## Testing Verification

Based on your database data:
- Issue `ad8d658b-cd78-4b00-ad21-70d47148540c` with status `"resolved"` should now show as completed (green check)
- Issue `f1cc47ed-7ec0-4535-9ed9-6638f2acc015` with status `"resolved"` should now show as completed (green check)
- Issues with status `"open"` should show as pending (red X)

## Root Cause Summary
The issue was **not** with:
- ❌ Backend API endpoints
- ❌ Database updates  
- ❌ RTK Query cache invalidation
- ❌ Real-time refresh mechanisms

The issue **was** with:
- ✅ Frontend status display logic not recognizing `'resolved'` as a completed status
- ✅ Missing status value mapping for issue entity type

This was a pure frontend display bug where the data was correct but the UI logic was incomplete.
