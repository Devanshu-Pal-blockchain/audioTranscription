# Final Issue Status Display Fix

## Problem Identified ✅
User feedback: "the number of issues that were fixed or resolved were four but you can see that on the individual cards we still see the pending chip right and also all above the column head there you can see zero green ticks with 5 Red Cross"

## Two Specific Issues Fixed

### 1. Status Badge/Chip Still Showing "Pending" ✅
**Location:** `TaskListCard.jsx` line ~472
**Problem:** Status badge was only checking `item.status === 'completed'` but not `'resolved'`

**Before:**
```javascript
{item.status === 'completed' ? 'Completed' : 'Pending'}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{item.type === 'issue' 
    ? (isCompleted ? 'Resolved' : 'Open')
    : (isCompleted ? 'Completed' : 'Pending')
}
```

### 2. Header Count Showing "✓ 0 ✕ 5" Instead of Correct Counts ✅
**Location:** `TaskListCard.jsx` line ~348
**Problem:** `completedCount` calculation was only checking for `'completed'`/`'done'` but not `'resolved'`

**Before:**
```javascript
const completedCount = displayItems.filter(
    (item) => item.completed === true || item.status === 'completed' || item.status === 'done'
).length;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const completedCount = displayItems.filter((item) => {
    return item.completed === true || 
           item.status === 'completed' || 
           item.status === 'done' || 
           item.status === 'resolved';
}).length;
```

## Expected Results ✅

Based on your database showing 4 resolved issues:

### Header Count Should Now Show:
- **✓ 4** (resolved issues)
- **✕ 1** (open issues)
- **5 issues** (total)

### Individual Cards Should Show:
- **Green badge with "Resolved"** for issues with status `'resolved'`
- **Yellow badge with "Open"** for issues with status `'open'`
- **Green checkmark icons** for resolved issues
- **Red X icons** for open issues

## Summary
Both the **status badges** and **header counts** are now using the correct logic that recognizes `'resolved'` as a completed status for issues. The display should now be fully dynamic and accurate!
