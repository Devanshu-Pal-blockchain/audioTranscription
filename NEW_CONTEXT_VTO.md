# EOS VTO PLATFORM - COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT & IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## PROJECT REDEFINITION - VERSION 2.0

### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This document outlines the complete transformation of our existing quarterly-focused meeting transcription system into a comprehensive EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) VTO (Vision, Traction, Organizer) implementation platform. The project now serves C-level executives across yearly, quarterly, and weekly meeting cycles with advanced IDS (Issues, Decisions, Solutions) workflow management.

---

## **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **Existing Implementation Strengths**
- ✅ Robust FastAPI backend with async operations
- ✅ JWT authentication and role-based access control
- ✅ Audio transcription pipeline using Groq Whisper
- ✅ MongoDB with Motor for async database operations
- ✅ Pydantic models for data validation
- ✅ RAG implementation using LangChain
- ✅ Structured JSON parsing and database integration
- ✅ User, Quarter, Rock, and Task collections established
- ✅ Two-way reference management between collections
- ✅ Comment system with admin privileges
- ✅ Background processing for audio transcription

### **Current Workflow**
1. **Meeting Creation**: User creates meeting → selects quarter → adds participants
2. **Audio Processing**: Real-time recording OR upload audio/transcript files
3. **Transcription Pipeline**: Audio → Raw transcript → Structured JSON → Database
4. **Data Extraction**: Generate rocks and tasks → Assign to users → Display in UI
5. **Management**: Users view assigned rocks/tasks, add comments, track progress

### **Current Database Collections**
- **Users**: employee_id, name, email, role, assigned_rocks
- **Quarters**: quarter_id, quarter, year, weeks, title, participants, status
- **Rocks**: rock_id, rock_name, smart_objective, quarter_id, assigned_to_id/name
- **Tasks**: task_id, rock_id, week, task, sub_tasks, comments
- **Transcript**: Raw and structured transcript storage

## **VTO TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **VTO IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE**

#### **1. MEETING TYPE CLASSIFICATION**
```typescript
MeetingTypes = {
  yearly: {
    frequency: "Once per year",
    duration: "Full year scope",
    focus: "Long-term strategic planning (3-5 year vision), annual company rocks",
    participants: "C-level executives only",

  }
}
```

#### **2. USER ROLES (SIMPLIFIED)**
```typescript
UserRoles = {
  facilitator: {
    description: "Meeting facilitator with admin privileges",
    permissions: "Can create/edit all content, manage all meetings",
    count: "One or more (open-ended)",
    rock_assignments: "Can be assigned any type of rocks"
  },
  employee: {
    description: "C-level executives participating in meetings", 
    permissions: "Can view/edit assigned content, participate in meetings",
    count: "Multiple employees",
    rock_assignments: "Can be assigned any type of rocks"
  }
  // NOTE: NO ADMIN ROLE - only facilitator and employee
}
```

RockTypes = {
  annual_rocks: {
    timeframe: "365 days",
    max_count: 5,
    scope: "Company-wide strategic initiatives", 
    owners: "C-level executives",
    measurable_success: "Required for all rock types",
    smart_criteria: "Rocks are inherently SMART (no separate smart_objective field)"
  },
  company_rocks: {
    timeframe: "90 days (quarterly)",
    scope: "Organization-level objectives",
    assignment: "Multiple individuals can have same company rock",
    parent: "annual_rocks (optional)",
    measurable_success: "Required for all rock types"
  },
  individual_rocks: {
    timeframe: "90 days (quarterly)", 
    scope: "Personal/department objectives",
    assignment: "One-to-one mapping with individuals",
    parent: "company_rocks (optional)",
    measurable_success: "Required for all rock types"
  }
}
```

#### **4. TODO SYSTEM (PARALLEL TO ROCKS)**
```typescript
ToDoSystem = {
  todos: {
    timeframe: "1-14 days (1-2 weeks maximum)",
    relationship_to_rocks: "PARALLEL entities, not nested under rocks",
    parent_rock: "Can optionally reference a parent rock but are independent",
    milestones: "NO MILESTONES under to-dos (milestones are only for rocks)",
    completion_tracking: "Status field (pending/in_progress/completed)",
    assignment: "Single owner per to-do"
  },
  rocks_vs_todos: {
    rocks: {
      timeframe: "15-90 days (quarterly scope)",
      has_milestones: "YES - weekly milestones (default 12 for quarterly)",
      smart_criteria: "Inherently SMART",
      completion_tracking: "Status + percentage_completion (calculated, not stored)"
    },
    todos: {
      timeframe: "1-14 days", 
      has_milestones: "NO - are independent task units",
      parallel_nature: "Run parallel to rocks, not as sub-tasks",
      completion_tracking: "Status field only"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **5. IDS SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION (UPDATED)**
```typescript
IDS_Structure = {
  issues: {
    type: "array",
    description: "All problems/challenges discussed in meeting",
    classification: "Identified during transcription analysis",
    fields_removed: ["category", "priority"], // NO CATEGORIZATION OR PRIORITY
    required_fields: ["title", "description", "mentioned_by (if certain)", "timestamp", "status", "summary"],
    status: "open/resolved (simple boolean-like status for UI checkboxes)"
  },
  solutions: {
    runtime_solutions: {
      timeframe: "Immediate (solved in meeting)",
      status: "completed",
      description: "On-the-spot resolutions"
    },
    todos: {
      timeframe: "1-14 days", 
      relationship: "PARALLEL to rocks, can reference parent_rock",
      milestones: "NONE - to-dos are independent units",
      completion_tracking: "Status field with UI checkboxes"
    },
    rocks: {
      timeframe: "15-90 days",
      smart_criteria: "Inherently SMART (no separate smart_objective field)", 
      milestones: "Weekly sub-components (default 12 for quarterly)",
      completion_tracking: "Status + calculated percentage_completion",
      owners: "Single responsible person",
      measurable_success: "Required for ALL rock types"
    }
  },
  open_issues: {
    description: "Problems without assigned solutions",
    status: "pending",
    follow_up: "Require future discussion"
  }
}
```

#### **6. COMPLETION TRACKING & ANALYTICS**
```typescript
CompletionTracking = {
  status_fields: {
    usage: "All entities use status fields instead of boolean completion flags",
    ui_representation: "Checkboxes for completion status",
    calculation: "Counts and percentages calculated from status, not stored"
  },
  quarterly_analytics: {
    todo_counts: "Total to-dos created, completed, pending by individual",
    milestone_counts: "Total milestones completed by individual", 
    rock_completion: "Rocks completed by type (annual/company/individual)",
    summary_requirements: "Every entity must have summary field"
  },
  percentage_completion: {
    rocks: "Calculated from milestone completion, not stored in JSON",
    milestones: "NO percentage_completion field - use status only",
    todos: "NO percentage tracking - simple status completion"
  }
}
```

#### **7. AUDIO RECORDING & SESSION MANAGEMENT**
```typescript
RecordingFlow = {
  use_cases: {
    instant_recording: "Live recording with pause/resume functionality",
    audio_upload: "Upload pre-recorded audio files (multiple files supported)",
    transcript_upload: "Upload transcript files (multiple files supported)"

    pause_resume: "Within each session, multiple pause/resume actions",
    audio_chunks: "Each pause creates an audio chunk with incremental ID"
  },
  processing_flow: {
    pause_action: "Send audio chunk to backend → transcribe → assign incremental ID → store temp",
    chunk_combination: "Pass previous transcript + ID to next chunk → amend transcript",
    session_end: "Combine all chunks into final session transcript with session summary",
    day_end: "User selects which sessions to include in final processing"
  },
  file_handling: {
    no_file_paths: "NO audio_file_path or transcript_file_path in meeting collection",

    quarter?: number,
    week?: number,
    meeting_number: number
  },
  participants: UUID[],
  status: "draft|in_progress|completed", // Optional field
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date
  // NOTE: NO audio_file_path, NO transcript_file_path
}

// issues collection - SIMPLIFIED  
{
  issue_id: UUID,

    async def determine_timeline_context(self, meeting_type: str, meeting_data: dict) -> dict:
        """Determine year, quarter, week context"""
        
    async def validate_meeting_structure(self, meeting_data: dict) -> bool:
        """Validate meeting data structure"""
```

#### **2.2 Enhanced Transcription Pipeline**

    async def classify_solutions_by_timeframe(self, solutions: list) -> dict:
        """Classify solutions into runtime/todo/rock categories"""
        
    async def generate_time_slot_analysis(self, transcript: dict) -> list:
        """Generate time-based analysis of discussion topics"""
```

#### **2.3 IDS Analysis Service**
```python
class IDSAnalysisService:
    async def extract_issues(self, transcript_segments: list) -> list:
        """Extract and classify issues from transcript"""
        
    async def identify_solutions(self, transcript_segments: list, issues: list) -> dict:
        """Identify and categorize solutions"""
        
    async def create_smart_rocks(self, solutions: list, meeting_context: dict) -> list:
        """Create SMART rocks from identified solutions"""
        
    async def generate_summaries(self, ids_data: dict) -> dict:
        """Generate summaries for all IDS components"""
```

### **Phase 3: API Enhancement**

#### **3.1 New Route Modules**
```python
# routes/meeting.py - Meeting management
# routes/ids.py - IDS workflow management  
# routes/milestone.py - Milestone tracking
# routes/timeline.py - Time-based queries
# routes/analytics.py - Reporting and analytics
```

#### **3.2 Enhanced Existing Routes**
- Update `/upload` routes for new meeting types
- Enhance rock routes for new rock types
- Add timeline filtering to all relevant endpoints
- Implement percentage completion tracking

### **Phase 4: RAG Enhancement**

#### **4.1 Context Management**
```python
class EnhancedRAGService:
    async def store_meeting_context(self, meeting_data: dict):
        """Store comprehensive meeting context"""
        
    async def query_historical_context(self, query: str, meeting_type: str) -> dict:
        """Query historical meeting data"""
        
    async def highlight_transcript_sections(self, query: str, meeting_id: UUID) -> list:
        """Highlight relevant transcript sections"""
```

2. **Multiple Methods**: Live recording, audio upload, transcript upload supported
3. **User Selection**: Users choose which sessions to include in final processing
4. **No File Paths**: No audio_file_path or transcript_file_path in meeting collection
5. **Temp Storage**: Use temporary folders for processing, not database storage
6. **Quality Control**: AI assessment of transcript quality with user notification

### **Data Editing Rules**
1. **Raw Transcript**: Non-editable (factual record)
2. **All Other Data**: Fully editable by facilitators and assigned owners
3. **Summaries**: Auto-generated but editable
4. **Timestamps**: Optional but preserved when available
5. **Session Management**: Users control which sessions are processed
